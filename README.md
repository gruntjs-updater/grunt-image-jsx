> Run JSX scripts on image files

## Getting Started

This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.5`

Only OS X is supported at the moment.

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-image-jsx --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-image-jsx');
```

## The "imagejsx" task

The task calls a JSX file on every single image given as `src`. The task itself does not create a destination file,
and does not modify existing files.

The destination file needs to be generated by the JSX script. Source and destination file are passed to the script
as the first two arguments with their full paths.

For an example JSX file, see [invert.jsx](https://github.com/b263/grunt-image-jsx/blob/master/test/invert.jsx).

### Overview

In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `imagejsx` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  imagejsx: {
    options: {
      // Task-specific options go here.
      jsx: 'test/invert.jsx',
      debug: 'on runtime error'
    },
    your_target: {
      // Target-specific file lists and/or options go here.
    },
  },
});
```

### Options

#### Required

##### **`debug`** (String)

Path to the JSX file to execute on every source file.

#### Optional

##### **`debug`** (String)

* Default value: `'on runtime error'`
* Other possible values: `'never', 'before running'`
